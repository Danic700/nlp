<subject>How do you make a puppy stop biting fingers/toes/any body part while playing?</subject><content>My shiba inu puppy is 14 weeks old, and she loooves to play.  For some reason, she likes to bite (not a hard bite) fingers / toes / arms / legs / my hair / clothes... pretty much anything.  &#xa;&#xa;I\'ve read a lot of ideas online like - say "no bite!" and stop playing with her (she\'ll just run after you and bite more), turn around and face the other way until she stops (this hurts too much!), give her a toy to play with instead (she will bite the toy and then go back to the fingers holding the toy), etc.&#xa;&#xa;Let me know if you have any other suggestions!</content><maincat>Pets</maincat>
