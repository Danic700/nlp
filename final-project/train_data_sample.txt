<subject>How to handle a 1.5 year old when hitting?</subject><content>Hi,&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our 17 month old has started hitting, we don\'t believe in physical discipline. Any tips other parents would recommend?&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We currently tell him "no hitting", "hitting hurts", and he kind of gets it. But sometimes clearly that doesn\'t help much...particularly when he\'s frustrated.&#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any tips?</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>
<subject>How can I avoid getting sick in China?</subject><content>I'm planning a trip to China. I'm an adventurous eater and I'd like to think my stomach can handle anything that I encounter that appeals to me.  But I know that's risky! Is there anything in particular precautions I should take or things I should avoid to stay healthy on the trip? &#xd;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.</content><maincat>Travel</maincat>
